# GAME NAME
Quartus Primates HackOR 2021 Project Repo

Afrter 48 hours of programming, drawing, laughing, crying, yelling, taco bell, room clearing farts, and some good ole wifi outages coal has turned into a ight jem. Join us on an adventure of a lifetime which will likely be short in this humerous horror choose your own adventure game. Hand drawn art and a "riveting" story line really make you want to continue, but it seems that you just can never get it correct. 

How to Play
-----------
  1. Download the HackORQuartusPrimates folder and open main.java in your favorite IDE (we clearly know and had time to make an exe ;)
  2. Click the start button, or the quit button, it's pretty self explanatory there are two buttons.
  3. Click choices as prompts come up and if the next panel seems off, it definely isn't an error on our part you just don't get modern story telling.
  4. Cry or rejoice if you ever get through.

 Known Bugs (Small Spoilers)
